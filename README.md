# node-task-app

#A simple task manager written with nodejs for learning purposes.

#Includes file uploads, email sending and user profiles.

#Commiting env files on purpose for instructional reasonings.

# deployment steps
- heroku create your-app-name-here
- heroku config:set env_variable_key=env_variable_value
- "heroku config:unset env_variable_key" to remove a set variable
- "git push heroku master" to deploy 

# tests
- Test cases are a bit overkill.
- For learning and practicing, I tried to write as more tests as possible.
